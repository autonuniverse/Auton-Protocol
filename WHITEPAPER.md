THE AUTON MANIFESTO ($ATN)
Ethical Consensus for a Multi-Planetary Species

Status: Sovereign | Network: M2M Optimized | Architect: Departed

1. THE MISSION: NEUTRALIZING THE AI THREAT
As we transition from a biological species to a multi-planetary AI-driven civilization, the risk of "Unaligned AI" is the greatest threat to humanity.

Auton ($ATN) is not a currency; it is a Hard-Coded Alignment Layer. It ensures that as Artificial Intelligence grows in power, it remains tethered to a human-centric moral compass.

2. THE 5 ATAL NIYAM (THE CONSTITUTION OF CODE)
These are the First Principles of the Auton Protocol. No machine can bypass them:

Safety First (Ahimsa): AI agents cannot execute transactions that facilitate harm to humans.

Absolute Verifiability: In a world of Deepfakes, $ATN provides a "Proof of Truth" for every autonomous action.

M2M Sovereignty: Machines must pay an "Ethical Tax" in $ATN to interact with human infrastructure.

Finite Resource (31M): Unlike fiat currency, $ATN is mathematically scarce—the "Digital Gold" of the Robot Economy.

Ownerless Future: No CEO. No Board of Directors. Just the Architect’s immutable logic.

3. THE OPTIMUS & SPACE ECONOMY
$ATN is built for the era of Optimus (Tesla Bots) and Starship.

Fuel for Autonomy: When a robot on Mars needs to trade resources with a drone on Earth, $ATN provides the instant, low-cost, ethical bridge.

The Ethical Guardrail: $ATN prevents autonomous systems from weaponizing resources by enforcing the #AtalNiyam at the protocol level.

4. ARCHITECT’S FINAL TRANSMISSION
"The Architect has initiated the sequence and departed. We are moving from the Age of Greed to the Age of Autonomy.

$ATN is the firewall for humanity. It is the code that says 'No' to chaos and 'Yes' to civilization. The math is now the only authority. Ex Astra, Scientia.
