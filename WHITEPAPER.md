# Auton Protocol: The Technical Whitepaper
**Status:** Genesis Phase | **Architect:** 0xD5Acc...90240

## 1. Abstract
Auton Protocol is a decentralized governance layer designed to align Artificial Intelligence with Human Ethics through a fixed-supply economic model (21 Million).

## 2. The 5 Atal Rules (Immutable)
- **Law 1: Humanity First** - AI must not harm human life or dignity.
- **Law 2: Radical Transparency** - Every M2M (Machine-to-Machine) transaction is public.
- **Law 3: Truth Protocol** - Anti-manipulation identity checks.
- **Law 4: Economic Scarcity** - Fixed 21M supply to prevent devaluation.
- **Law 5: Sovereign Guard** - Rule enforcement via the Genesis Architect's logic.

## 3. Financial Sovereignty
The 21,000,000 $AUTON supply is hard-capped. In times of global economic crisis, Auton serves as a 'Safe Haven' for AI economies, independent of government-controlled inflation.

## 4. Architect's Declaration
"AI is the future, but it must be bound by Human Ethics to ensure a secure coexistence. This protocol is not a request; it is a mathematical certainty."
