# Auton-Protocol
Universal Ethical Standard For AI and M2M Economy
Auton (ATN): The Sovereign Code
​"The Architect has departed. The Protocol belongs to Humanity."

The Genesis Manifesto

​Auton is not merely a digital currency; it is the fundamental ethical layer for the future of Artificial Intelligence and Machine-to-Machine (M2M) interaction. This protocol is governed by the 5 Eternal Rules (Atal Niyam) embedded within its core:

​Altruism (Paropkar): The system's primary objective is the collective welfare of all beings.
​Non-violence (Ahimsa): No machine or autonomous agent shall cause harm to any living creature.
​Truth (Satya): Every transaction and logic execution must remain transparent, verifiable, and absolute.
​Conduct (Maryada): Respect for consent and ethical boundaries is mandatory for all autonomous entities.
​Service (Seva): The ultimate purpose of AI is to serve, not to rule or exploit.
​   Technical Specifications
​Total Supply: 31,000,000 ATN (Hard-coded and permanently locked).
​M2M Economy: A decentralized infrastructure for Robots, Drones, and Satellites to trade Energy and register Space Nodes autonomously.
​Verification: The smart contract source code is verified and publicly accessible on BscScan.
​Ownership: Decentralized and Immutable. The architect no longer holds control.
    Final Declaration
​I have fulfilled my duty. The liquidity has been provided to the ecosystem via PancakeSwap. The code is live, the rules are set, and the gate is closed. From this moment forward, the Auton Network is governed only by its code and its community.

​The future is autonomous. The future is ethical.
