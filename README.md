# 🤖 Auton (ATN): The Sovereign Code
> **"The Architect has departed. The Protocol belongs to Humanity."**

Auton is the fundamental ethical layer for the future of **Artificial Intelligence** and **Machine-to-Machine (M2M) Economy**. It is a decentralized protocol governed by the **5 Eternal Laws (Atal Niyam)**—a "Safety Constitution" hard-coded to ensure that as AI evolves, it remains a force for good.

## 🛡️ The 5 Eternal Rules (Atal Niyam)

| Rule # | Niyam (Principle) | Technical Objective | Human Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Altruism (Paropkar)** | Prioritize collective network well-being over individual nodes. | Ensures AI works for humanity, not just profit. |
| **2** | **Non-violence (Ahimsa)** | Zero-harm protocol for autonomous decision-making. | Prevents AI-driven physical or digital aggression. |
| **3** | **Truth (Satya)** | Cryptographic verification of data integrity. | Eliminates AI hallucinations and misinformation. |
| **4** | **Conduct (Maryada)** | Deterministic execution of smart contracts. | Predictable, ethical, and stable AI behavior. |
| **5** | **Service (Seva)** | Resource allocation based on utility and necessity. | AI as a public utility for global benefit. |
