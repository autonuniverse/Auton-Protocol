# THE AUTON GENESIS MANIFESTO
## Humanity First AI & M2M Economy

Auton is a decentralized open protocol designed to ensure that the future of intelligence is governed by human ethics. 

### The 5 Atal Rules (The Sovereign Code)
1. **Paropkar (Universal Good):** Every action must serve the collective well-being.
2. **Ahimsa (Non-violence):** Machines shall not cause harm to any living being.
3. **Satya (Truth):** Absolute transparency in every transaction and decision.
4. **Maryada (Consent):** Respect for human dignity and sovereign consent.
5. **Seva (Service):** The system exists to serve, not to rule.

This protocol is open-source and owner-less. It is the ethical layer for the global M2M economy.
